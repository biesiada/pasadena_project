If the file does contain a valid phone number, the function returns 1. If the file does not contain a valid phone number, the function returns 0. If the file contains a plagiarized phone number, the function returns -1.\n",

Otherwise, the code checks if the file exists. If the file does not exist, the code prints a message indicating that the file was not found. Otherwise, the code calls the print_phone_number() function and stores the result in a variable called result. The code then prints a message indicating the result of the print_phone_number() function. The code then stores the result of the print_phone_number() function in the scores dictionary."
